      <h4>Pedro Coutinho <span>:: Partner &amp; Head of Sales</span></h4>
      <p>
        Being a seasoned IT professional, Pedro had the opportunity to work as an IT Manager in a range 
        of industries, namely Healtcare, Games and Hardware Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ruby and Ruby on Rails popped in Pedro's radar and unveiled his passion for software development, or as he 
        says "the art or bringing ideas to life".
      </p>
      <p>
        With years of experience dealing with customers, end-users and communities, Pedro found himself in need of 
        a bigger and passionate project. With this in mind he co-founded Gnomeslab with Diogo Almeida and Miguel 
        Teixeira.
      </p>

      <h4>Miguel Teixeira <span>:: Partner &amp; Engineer</span></h4>
      <p>
        After years of web development using Microsoft's ASP.net and PHP, Miguel realized that the <i>spark</i> 
        was gone. While his days were becoming more and more boring, he realized that not only he was unlearning 
        all the good practices, but also that things could (and should) be fundamentally different for the 
        clients and their end users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Miguel usually says that Ruby and Ruby on Rails rescued his web development career. After being rescued he 
        co-founded Gnomeslab with Diogo Almeida and Pedro Coutinho, where he takes joy in mastering the art of 
        taking a PSD file and turning it into a live and immersive web experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being passionate about User Experience, Miguel likes to attend related conferences and workshops. Don't 
        forget to ping him if you him there!
